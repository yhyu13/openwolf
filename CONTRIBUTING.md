## Making Changes

1. Create a branch: `git checkout -b my-change`
2. Make your changes
3. Build and verify: `pnpm build && node dist/bin/openwolf.js --help`
4. Commit with a clear message describing **what** and **why**
5. Push and open a pull request

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused. One feature or fix per PR.
- Describe what your PR does and why in the description.
- If your change is platform-specific, note which platforms you tested on.
- Update `README.md` if you add or change commands.
- Update `src/templates/` if you change the `.wolf/` file structure.

## Reporting Bugs

Open an issue at [github.com/cytostack/openwolf/issues](https://github.com/cytostack/openwolf/issues) with:

- Your OS and Node.js version
- Claude Code version
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Relevant logs (if any)

## Platform Notes

OpenWolf supports Windows, macOS, and Linux. Platform-specific code is centralized in `src/utils/platform.ts`. If your change involves process management, file paths, or shell commands, make sure it works across platforms or uses the platform utilities.
